# Cards-Shuffle
You will define two classes â€“ one to
represent a playing card with a rank and a suit, and one to represent a deck
of cards (these are the model classes). Then you will repeatedly shuffle and
deal hands, and create a histogram of the results. The view class for this
assignment uses a main method and Standard Input and Output.

Example output: 

How many suits? 2
How many ranks? 3

Deck of 6 cards: low = 1 high = 6 top = Card S1R1
1=shuffle, 2=deal 1 hand, 3=deal 100000 times, 4=quit: 1

Deck of 6 cards: low = 1 high = 6 top = Card S2R1
